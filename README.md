I am a data scientist at the University of Southampton, where I performed applied ML research in healthcare.

Primarily, I research the development of clinical decision support tools for use in healthcare. I lead the ML component of an Alan Turing Institute [funded project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/decision-support-algorithms-emergency-departments) looking at decision support tools in emergency departments, [investigate](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/news/6795) how decision support tools can help streamline fertility treatment, and look at how data self-reported to medical smartphone applications can be used to predict exacerbation events for patients who suffer from COPD as part of the [BigMedilytics project](https://www.bigmedilytics.eu/). Recently, I have also been performing research in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

When I have some free time I can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fchmiel).
