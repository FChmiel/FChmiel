I am a Senior Data Scientist at Neu Health, a digital health start-up developing a platform for the remote management of patients with Parkinsonâ€™s & dementia. 

Previously, I worked at the University of Southampton as a applied researcher in healthcare. Here I researched the development of clinical decision support tools for use in healthcare. I led the ML component of an Alan Turing Institute [funded project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/decision-support-algorithms-emergency-departments) looking at decision support tools in emergency departments, [investigated](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/news/6795) how decision support tools can help streamline fertility treatment, and looked at how data self-reported to medical smartphone applications can be used to predict exacerbation events for patients who suffer from COPD.
